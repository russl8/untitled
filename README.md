## About the project
A centralized dashboard to streamline my daily workflow.<br/>  
Before building this project, my Chrome bookmarks bar was overflowing with outdated links, and tracking my workouts meant manually jotting down exercises in my phoneâ€™s Notes app. I wanted a single, organized space to manage everything efficiently, and to eliminate clutter and reduce the need for multiple apps.
